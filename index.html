          <p>Environmental data defines all data related to the <code>ecologic systems</code>. It is collected with the help of universitary and research centers, and those of environmental agencies. It is used in the evaluation of the ecosystems state and evolution in space and time, and in many decision making policies setting environment standards and to measure economic impacts.</p></article>

           <p><code>Soil sampling</code> is useful for determining the structure and function of the soil organisms and microorganisms community. Study subjects include type of organisms living in the soil, the plant roots structure, leaf litter break down and decomposition. It can be used by ecoforestation research teams for studying an ecosystem and also for example by farmers as decision factor in the rotation of plant cultures.
           </p>
         <p><u>A few known methods used by researchers for sampling soil are:</u>
             <ul>
               <li>Nematode Sampling<p>Baermann funnels are useful for measurement of microfauna and microorganism abundance and richness in a soil sample. A funnel with a small mesh or muslin lining on the inside is attached via tube to the bottom of the funnel, which is clamped shut at the bottom. When the soil is placed in the funnel, it is then filled with water. Organisms like nematodes will move down through the soil and water, through the mesh and into the bottom of the tube. After 24 to 48 hours, the clamp is opened, allowing the organisms to drain into a petri dish. Samples can then be identified via microscopy.</p>
               </li>
               <li>Ground Level Arthropod Sampling<p>Tullgren funnels are used to assess species richness in leaf litter arthropods. Leaf litter samples are typically placed in Tullgren funnels to sample for soil micro- and mesofauna. The Tullgren apparatus consists of a funnel, a light source, a screen, and a receptacle into which the animals fall. The sample is placed in a funnel that is lined with a screen with the light source above; the extraction process works by desiccating the soil from above via heat lamp, forcing the fauna downward through the funnel into the sampling liquid below.
                 </p>
               </li>
               <li>Root Sampling<p>Rhizotrons are laboratories constructed underground in order to study the soil and its interactions with plants and animals. Rhizotrons are typically equipped with a central corridor with viewing windows into the soil profiles on either side. On the outside, separate bays are constructed to enable specific experiments to be carried out by varying the soil composition and the plant and animals contained therein. Rhizotrons come in various sizes, which allow for study at multiple scales. The roots grow up to the windows allowing to see the way the roots grow. Using this method we can see how thick roots are, how deep they go and how wide spread the roots grow for different plants in different soil types. Using a rhizotron is very useful in a forest for research as scientists can measure and observe the interactions that occur on and rhizosphere. From the roots holding down the tree or other plants, to the interactions with the micro organisms living next to the root hairs. Scientists can learn a lot for using a rhizotron in a way that preserves the environment.</p>
               </li>
           </ul>
         </p>
      <p>Farmers also sample soil for P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Zn, Na, CEC, pH, Lime Req. Organic Matter, Sand %, Silt %, Clay %, soil texture classification.</p>

         <p><code>Water</code> can be sampled for measurements of turbidity, light penetration, temperature, organic carbon total and disolved, ph, nutrients, lipids, heavy metals, pesticides, and other elements. Within the water sample bacteria, zooplancton and fitoplancton can also be sampled, which vary depending on the site/ water body sampled. Sample collection of the entire water column can be carried upstream and downstream, or in different locations depending the affluents and the study. 
         </p>
         <p><u>A few common methods for sampling or measuring samples of <code>water</code> are:</u></p>
           <ul>
             <li>Sampling cilinders
             </li>
             <li>Sieves used for eliminating plancton
             </li>
             <li>Dredges (marine sampling)
             </li>
             <li>Nets 
             </li>
             <li>Peristaltic pumps 
             </li>
             <li>Measuring water depth and PAR with a light meter instrument (an Underwater Quantum Sensor (Licor) attached to a Data Logger
             </li>
             <li>Turbidity meters
             </li>
             <li>Spectrophotometers
             </li>
             <li>Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) - measure how fast water is moving across an entire water column.
             </li>
             <li>Acoustic Recording Package​ - record marine mammal sounds
             </li>
             <li>BIOMAPER-II - used to study about phytoplankton and zooplankton over areas that are too large to study with the traditional net-and-microscope method.
             </li>
            <p>The water samples are placed in different glass bottles with different acid preservants depending on the element measured or no preservants if measuring organic matter, kept on ice and filtered in the laboratory the same day. Filters are then processed and analyzed.</p>
             <p>An example of calculation of spectral CDOM absorbtion coefficients at each wavelength (aCDOM(λ)(m−1
               ))in water is:<br><br><code id="formula">a(λ)=(2.303 A(λ))/l</code> 
</ul>
         <p><code>Ice</code> is sampled for analysis of the algae content and carbon dioxide or other gases/ elements content of different ice layers. To sample ice we can use a mechanical drill - simply a rotating pipe, or drill barrel, with cutters at the head. When the drill barrel is rotated, the cutters incise a circle around the ice to be cored until the barrel is filled with ice. Ice cores are cylinders of ice drilled from ice sheets and glaciers. They are essentially frozen time capsules that allow scientists to reconstruct climate far into the past. Layers in ice cores correspond to years and seasons, with the youngest ice at the top and the oldest ice at the bottom of the core. By looking at past concentrations of greenhouse gasses in layers in ice cores, scientists can calculate how modern amounts of carbon dioxide and methane compare to those of the past, and, essentially, compare past concentrations of greenhouse gasses to temperature.</p>

         <p>Researchers are measuring the vegetation species richness and diversity thrrough various methods.
         </p>
         <p> A few common methods used are :
         <ul>
           <li>Using Quadrats - frame quadrats and point quadrats, frequency and composition
           </li>
           <li>Qualitative Sampling - estimating abundance, including the ACFOR scale
           </li>
           <li>Transects - Sampling vegetation along an environmental gradient
           </li>
         </ul></p>
<p>Ecology researchers study species interactions, species–environment relationships, and the relationship of plant diversity to the structure and function of ecosystems. These interactions are sensitive to change. Disturbance, land use, trade and transportation, and changing climate result in the redistribution of species in novel environments, altered abundances, and local extirpation. The examples are numerous and from all parts of the world, yet considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of accelerating changes such as climate change, species invasions, and ecological heterogeneity on the status and trending patterns of plant diversity persists.</p>
<p>Concepts such as rotation of cultures in agriculture to avoid draining the soil of the same nutrients and such as reforestation with a variety of species disposed at specific distance of one another depending on the specie instead of reforrestaion using a single tree species are derived from these extensive studies.

        <p>When sampling a population, the numbers of organisms are counted within a sample site, and then the results multiplied to estimate the total number in the entire habitat. Large animals and plants can often simply be counted. However, many smaller animals like insects and smaller mammals need to be trapped first so they can be counted and then released afterwards.

        <p>Organisms can be collected using a variety of methods, including:
<ul>
  <li>nets</li>
  <li>pooters</li>
